## About this repo

This repo contains a number of notebooks for the 2021 Digital Humanities workshop at SISU in May - June 2021.


## Course Description

This course investigates the possibilities and pitfalls of computational text research for humanities students. It focuses on the text found in online social media platforms, and discusses the opportunities for critical humanities research of such datasets. Using text analytics, we will analyze how knowledge and ideas are created and negotiated on social media platforms. We will ask: how can we critically assess the algorithmically driven and often controversial claims to knowledge to be found on these platforms? In doing so, we will build skills in natural language processing and critical research.
